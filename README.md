Project Readme: Wargames
Overview
Welcome to Wargames, a simulation program developed by Aliaan Nadeem Azam as part of the IDATG2001 course at NTNU Gjøvik. Wargames allows users to engage in simulated battles between custom-designed armies. This readme provides comprehensive information about the project, including its purpose, features, design, and how to run the application.

1. Introduction
Wargames is a project developed as part of the IDATG2001 course at NTNU Gjøvik. The goal is to simulate battles between two armies, giving users the ability to design their armies and witness the outcomes of their strategic choices.

2. Features
Army Creation: Users can create custom armies from scratch, defining unit types, names, and attributes.
File Handling: Armies can be loaded from predefined files, providing a quick way to set up battles.
Graphical User Interface: The program features an intuitive GUI designed using Balsamiq Wireframes.
Battle Simulation: Engage in simulated battles between user-designed armies and view detailed battle results.

4.2 Design Principles and Patterns
The design adheres to Don Norman's principles of visibility and feedback, ensuring an intuitive and informative user experience. The application uses design patterns such as the factory pattern and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for efficient code organization.

4.3 Class Diagrams
Two class diagrams illustrate dependencies, fields, and methods in the project.

5. Implementation
The project structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for a tidy and organized codebase.

5.1 Model-View-Controller Design Pattern
The project structure provides a clear implementation of the MVC design pattern.

6. Process
Work on the project was carried out consistently and systematically throughout the semester. Implementation of new knowledge occurred continuously after lectures.

7. Reflection
The project has been educational, applying knowledge from the entire semester. Reflection includes challenges in interpreting project requirements and a local technical issue when attempting to run the application.

8. Conclusion
The Wargames project has been executed as a well-structured simulation of battles between armies. Acquired skills and knowledge are significant, despite some interpretation challenges. The project has contributed to a deeper understanding of programming and system development.
